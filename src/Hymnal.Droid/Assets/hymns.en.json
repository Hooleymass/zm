A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me! For me a blood-bought free reward, A golden harp for me! ¶ There in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy power to save, When this poor lisping, stammering tongue Is ransomed from the grave, Is ransomed from the grave, Is ransomed from the grace; When this poor lisping, stammering tongue Is ransomed from the grave."

We speak of its service of love, Of the robes which glorified wear, Of the church of the First Born above' But what must it be to be there! ¶ Our mourning is all at an end, When, raised by the life-giving word, We see the new city descend, Adorned as a bride for her Lord; The city so holy and clean, No sorrow can breathe in the air; No gloom of affliction or sin, No shadow of evil, is there. ¶ Do Thou, midst temptation and woe, For heaven my spirit prepare; And shortly I also so shall know And feel what it is to be there. Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam, In glory celestial and fair, With saints and with angels at home, And Jesus Himself will be there."

    "content": "Master, the tempest is raging!  The billows are tossing high!  The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness;  No shelter or help is nigh;  Carest Thou not that we perish?  How canst Thou lie asleep,  When each moment so madly is threatening  A grave in the angry deep? ¶ Refrain \"The winds and the waves shall obey My will, Peace, be still!  Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,  Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,  No water can swallow the ship where lies  The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;  They all shall sweetly obey My will;  Peace, be still! Peace, be still! They all shall sweetly obey My will; Peace, peace, be still!\" ¶ Master, with anguish of spirit  I bow in my grief today;  The depths of my sad heart are troubled;  O, waken and save, I pray!  Torrents of sin and of anguish  Sweep o'er my sinking soul;  And I perish! I perish I dear Master;  O hasten, and take control. ¶ Master, the terror is over,  The elements sweetly rest;  Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,  And heaven's within my breast;  Linger, 0 blessed Redeemer,  Leave me alone no more;  And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,  And rest on the blissful shore."

And may there be no moaning of the bar  When I put out to sea, ¶ But such a tide as moving seems asleep,  Too full for sound and foam,  When that which drew from out the boundless deep  Turns again home. ¶ Twilight and evening bell,  And after that the dark!  And may there be no sadness of fare-well  When I embark; ¶ For, though from out our bourne of time and place  The flood may bear me far,  I hope to see my Pilot face to face  When I have crossed the bar. Amen"

Clothe with the luster of Thy love  Each waning beam of mine.  From foes and friends who ever fail,  O'er storm-swept seas I find  Within the haven of Thine arms  A love most wondrous kind. ¶ Father, I yield to Thee my will,  I would submissive be,  Content to lean upon Thy breast  And hear Thee speak to me.  Grant me a heart in tune with Thine,  To see as Thou dost see,  That each desire, each word and thought,  May breathe, dear Lord, of Thee. ¶ Father, I yield to Thee my all,  My wanderings are o'er.  Earth's fleeting pleasures cease to call,  They shall deceive no more.  My doubts and tears lie all behind,  Eternal bliss before;  Lost in Thy love and wholly Thine  I'll rest forevermore."
